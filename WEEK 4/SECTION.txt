WEEK 4 SECTION - MEMORY

- what are pointers, and how can we become familiar with their syntax?
- how can we read and write data from a file?
- what is dynamic memory and how should we use it?

pointers

int calls = 4;
int *p = 0x1A; --> saves an address in memory

Pointer syntax
calls; --> will give us the value of this variable
p; --> will give you the value of that pointer

&calls; --> will give you the address of this variable
&p; --> will give you the address of this variable

*p; --> go to the value at address stored in p

type * is a pointer that stores the address of a type
*x takes a pointer x and goes to the address stored at that pointer
&x takes x and gets its address

int a = 28;
int b = 50;
int *c = &a;

*c = 14;
c = &b;
*c = 25;

File I/O

file input and file output

hi.txt
hi!
this file is located in memory, let's say 0x456

opening file in C

FILE *input = fopen("hi.txt", "r");

FILE * is the type that points somewhere
fopen("hi.txt", "r") is the value, the first argument is the file we want to open, the second argument is the mode either read "r" or write "w"

input 0x456 --> hi.txt

input is pointing towards the file
the file is composed of many bytes of memory
buffer is a place to store data as we read it from a file - could be a sequence of bytes, a data structure of array
fread(buffer, 1, 3, input); --> takes 4 arguments
input : is the file we're reading from, location to read data from
1 : size of blocks to read, in bytes
3 : how many blocks to read
buffer : location to store blocks
