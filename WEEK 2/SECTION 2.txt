SECTION WEEK 2 - ARRAYS

- what are the steps involved in compilation?
- what are arrays?
- whata re strings in the context of arrays?
- what's the point of command line arguments?
- what makes good design?

1. compilation

source code - assembly code - machine code(binary)
clang -o filename filename.c

2. arrays

- the most basic data structure
- one block of memory storing individual pieces of data

int hours[5] // type name length

- access the values of the array
hours[0] // it starts counting from index 0

- add data to array
hours[0] = 7;

- create array with pre-established values
int hours[] = {7, 8, 9, 8, 8};

- access an array with a for loop
int hours[] = {7, 8, 9, 8, 8};

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
  printf("%i\n", hours[i]);
}

3. strings

- strings are collections of characters
- an array of characters

string name = "Emma";
name[0] = E
name[1] = m
name[2] = m
name[3] = a
name[4] = \0 --> nul --> marks the end of the string

char name[] = {'e', 'm', 'm', 'a', '\0'};
